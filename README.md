# WordCount
Using NLP To Find Most Common Words In Text Documents.

Process the frequency or number of times the most common words in a text document occurs. This makes use of the NLTK
(Natural Language Toolkit) 3.0 in a Python 2.7.1x or 3.x environment. I am using Python version 2.7.10 as a virtual 
environment within a Python 3.6.5 Anaconda version. The code was originally in 2.7.10, but it can be modified to the
support the latest version.

The following modules must be imported:
- collections
- re
- nltk

The stopwords must also be imported from nltk.corpus.

The ff. is the synatx to run the code from a terminal command prompt (Linux, MacOS, Unix) or command prompt (Windows):

python <name_of_file>.py
